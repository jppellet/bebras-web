[AGE] ok
    [IDEA] Nice task with a clear connection with common applications
    [TEXT] The text seems to me too implicit: in particular I miss a key piece of information about the pictures, they are maps of the same region with the same scale,  this is the crucial point for the solution.
    [EXPL] It does not explain why overlapping makes sense
    [TiI] ok
    [TiCT] missing
    [GRAPH] ok
    [AUTH] ok
    [NAME] ok
    [OTHER] nothing

[EXPL] Is Ok.
[TiI] Yes.

It's a novel idea. However, the description and constraints of the task appear unclear or insufficient. And there is a lack of consideration for color blindness. TCT is missing.
