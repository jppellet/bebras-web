[AGE] In my opinion this task can be too hard for 6-8 yo, they may not have enough experience with spatial thinking. But for 8-10yo this task might be appropriate. I suggest hard level for 6-8 yo and medium for 8-10 yo.
[IDEA] The idea is good. 
[TEXT] Short and clear. 
[EXPL] Some examples-explanations why other figures are incorrect could be helpful.
[TiI] This part is missing.
[TiCT] OK
[GRAPH] Figures are clear and appealing, in SVG format. Unfortunately, there is no information about CC-license.
[AUTH] OK
[NAME] OK
[OTHER] Why the order of multiple-choice/-select should be kept? Informatics Keywords and Websites are missing.

[AGE] The task could be categorized as an easy one for also little bit older age groups?
[IDEA] The idea is good and seems original. Brings a new twist to the often appearing object ordering perception tasks.
[TEXT] The task text is very concise (only one sentence, and it already poses the question itself) while also being sufficient. No much room for improvement here!
[EXPL] The provided answer explanation seems like a quickly drafted sketch. It should be expanded into a more elaborate description (especially given that the task is directed towards the youngest students).
[TiI] The “It’s informatics” section is empty.
[TiCT] The “This is Computational Thinking” section exists and gives a short but reasonable description about how the task relates to computational thinking.
[GRAPH] The figures are cute cartoonish descriptions of a beaver and logs in svg format. No much room for improvement here, either.
[AUTH] Authors' names and emails are given.
[NAME] Seems ok.

The idea of the task is good-- having the students to observe and find out the "ordering" of the logs. However, it is unclear to me why the answer is D. Maybe a more elaborate answer explanation would help. Also, the It's informatics section is missing.
Since two logs can be propped against each other to form an arch like the shape of "ʌ" (which means both logs are the same order), it might be a bit hard for the students to determine the order of the logs. This issue can be easily fixed by re-drawing the image.
Over all, it's an interesting and fun easy task.
