The authors need to revise the answer numbers, as the correct answer is d and not c. Also, the figures for answers a and b are reversed.
I suggest changing the age group to 14-16 years

I think it the coding rules should be explained generally, not just for the examples given. This should include also the operator /.

There is a typo, as correct answer is d.
