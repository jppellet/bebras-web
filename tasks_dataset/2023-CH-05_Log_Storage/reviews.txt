Beautiful task and pictures. 
Another part of the It's informatics could be the organization of the hard drive, where files are deleted and new are placed, and the role of the file allocation table. 
An interactive solution part would be possible (put the new logs in order) or an interactive helper could be offered (play with it and deduce the proper order).

[AGE] Appropriate age levels.
[IDEA] Overall, this is a good Bebras task. The question may be more engaging/challenging in a drag and drop format, as it is fairly easy to determine the answer from the given options at present.
[TEXT] Addresses all aspects of the question in a good amount of text, in a logical fashion.
[EXPL] Thoroughly explains each of the answers, excellent.
[TiI Could use some editing for clarity, but otherwise strong.
[TiCT] Succinct.
[GRAPH] Very charming and appropriate graphics. I particularly appreciate the visual differences between several of the logs.

Nice task for this age group.
instead of "she places it as far left as she can". Maybe something like: She starts to fill the available space from the left using the first gap big enough ...
