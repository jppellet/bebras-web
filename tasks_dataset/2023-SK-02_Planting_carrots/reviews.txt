Cute! I like this task. I think it is a little bit harder than indicated. 
An easier version would be to give them the starting mound and sequence and then ask where the seeds are planted.

For the answer explanation, I don’t think it is necessary to show the sequences for the other answer options. Rather, leave this as an open activity for the reader. “Can you write a program for the rabbit that would plant seeds as shown in the other answer options? Will only one program work, or are there others?”

It's a good task. It can look attractive to young students. However, it doesn't look novel because there are many similar old problems. How about an interactive approach that gives you a goal and combines the commands you need to achieve it?

[AGE] I think it is too hard for 6-8yo.
[IDEA] Nice task. For the 6-8yo maybe we can give them the starting point.
[TEXT] The text is clear and understandable.
[EXPL] The explanation is ok, but I don't think it is necessary to explain in detail other answer options (the sequences).
[TiI] The "It's informatics" section is available and is understandable.
[TiCT] The "This is Computation Thinking" section is not available.
[GRAPH] The figures are in SVG format and they are self-made.
[AUTH] YES
[NAME] YES
